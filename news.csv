And such market volatility can offer excellent stocks at an enticing entry price, including both Apple and HP Inc., two large holdings that Warren Buffett picked. This article explores the deeper and hidden similarities between these two stocks beyond the obvious (both in the IT sector, and both are Buffett picks). Both are going through a contracting phase (yes, even Apple goes through cycles). And both are truly the quintessential examples of Buffett-style compounders. Both HP and Apple represent a rare species that combines both superb profitability and the ability to deploy incremental capital at equally (or even higher) profitable levels.",Positive

It has built one of the most powerful business ecosystems to have ever existed. The true power of this ecosystem was shown in its Q4 results, as the company beat analysts' estimates on the top and bottom lines. This was achieved in an earnings season where plenty of other big tech stocks had cratered, and macroeconomic headwinds were rife. I was not optimistic about Apple's Q4 earnings - how wrong I was.",Positive

But from time to time, some of his choices still come as a surprise and his recent position in Taiwan Semiconductor is a notable example. The choice is even more puzzling when viewed under the context of his largest holding, Apple. There are certainly positives with Taiwan Semiconductor, that is, even when compared to Apple. However, I see these positives easily overshadowed by the developing tension between them, which produces mutual but asymmetric damage.",Positive

Growth has decelerated across product lines and services, and the fact that Apple is not providing revenue guidance for the coming quarter is significant.

Therefore, we discuss why Wall Street's estimates for its December quarter seem to be at significant risk of further markdowns to reflect the severity of the headwinds in China. With AAPL overvalued at an NTM P/E of 24x (Vs. 10Y average of 17.5x), investors need to be prepared for value compression.

Recently, the iPhone 14 production cut rumor provided a good entry point, supply chain worries in 2020 did so too. Sometimes these reports do reflect an underlying reality, but the selling that occurs after them ignores Apple's diversified income streams. Apple makes money off at least 6 different hardware categories plus services. Because of this, rumors regarding single products being delayed or having their production reduced tend to be followed by surprisingly small earnings impacts.",Negative

Thanks to its advanced supply chains, successful products, and healthy balance sheet, Apple has pricing power, high and steady margins, and the ability to buy back shares.

With the recent return of COVID lockdowns in key production hubs in China, and deteriorating purchase power in the retail sector, Apple risks further underperformance ahead of its best-selling holiday-quarter.

On the other hand, Apple and its partners are working hard to reduce the dependency on China and increase the manufacturing capacities in India. The increasing revenue from the ""Services"" segment is likely to lead to a total gross margin expansion in the long term. For these reasons, we maintain our ""buy"" rating on Apple.",Positive

Apple isn't being rewarded for a blowout 2022 where they generated $99.8 billion of net income as shares are still -17.86% off their 52-week highs. Apple not only defended its margins in a high inflationary environment, but they improved its cost of revenue and gross profit margins in 2022. Apple is positioned to generate a 2023 consensus beat on earnings if they buyback shares at a similar rate and match 2022's earnings from operations generated.",Positive
0,4558283,AAPL,2022-11-16T08:30:00-05:00,Apple: How The Risk Of China Affects My Investment Thesis,"Apple revealed on November 6 that its iPhone assembly facility, located in Zhengzhou, China, is currently operating at reduced capacity due to COVID-19 restrictions. Although I do see several risk factors for Apple investors in the short term, such as the challenging macroeconomic environment, my investment thesis remains intact. I continue to rate Apple as a buy. This is due to the company’s strong competitive advantages and growth drivers as well as its current valuation. In my opinion, Apple continues to be the perfect buy-and-hold investment and I recommend that you benefit from its steadily growing dividend payments.",Positive

Their repurchases become even more potent when considered together. The double buybacks are compounding on steroids in essence. Especially, with the recent price corrections, these double buybacks become even more overpowering, unfazed by the minor headwinds from the 1% buyback taxes. Berkshire and Apple shareholders can only wish that such situation to perpetuate (in particular, those who own Apple shares indirectly from Berkshire). Returning capital this way is far better than paying dividends. It is a simple case of 1+1>2.",Positive

The risks continue to increase, especially given the recent developments at the Zhengzhou factory. What if Apple's liquidity, which has been halved in recent quarters, at some point no longer flows into share buybacks, but into redirecting production from China to India? What if Apple's gross margin had peaked, as it did in 1990 and 2012? Why should we pay so much today for such modest operational growth tomorrow? Apple stock is still a ""Hold"" for me.",Negative

The company shouldn't match the valuations of Alphabet, Amazon and Meta Platforms combined. Weak Mac sales and negative trends in App Store sales contribute to tough comps now following covid boosts in prior periods.

0,4552001,AAPL,2022-11-02T12:25:51-04:00,Apple's Resilience Is Unjustified - Here Is Why,"Apple stock has held up surprisingly well in 2022 compared to a very weak broader market, largely due to the company's continued strong earnings reports. I'll highlight the reasons for Apple's strong cash flow growth and potential areas for future growth, and take a look at working capital management, stock-based compensation, and the multi-faceted ecosystem. However, I will also point out the limitations of the growth story, which is the mainstay of the current valuation. The current share price implies growth rates that are difficult to achieve even in a thriving economy. I think Apple is dead money at best for the foreseeable future. I am not currently invested in the stock, but if I were, I would at least consider selling it, assuming I held it in a tax-deferred or tax-exempt account.",Positive

Outlook for the December quarter isn't too negative on an FX-adjusted basis, but Covid restrictions in China are something to look out for.

0,4551034,AAPL,2022-10-31T08:15:00-04:00,Apple: Why I Maintain My Buy Rating,"Apple presented strong 4Q22 results: the company increased its revenue by 8% compared to the same quarter of the previous year. While other companies from the technology sector such as Alphabet and Meta have recently shown slower growth rates than in the past, Apple continues its growth story. In this analysis, I will show you why I maintain my buy rating for Apple even though its valuation is currently not so attractive (P/E [FWD] Ratio of 24.46). I recommend that you see Apple as a long-term investment and invest in order to benefit from its growing dividend year over year.",Positive

However, we urge investors not to get caught up in what could be a short-term relief rally. We parse several red flags in Apple's ""growth"" story that investors must consider carefully. These could be structural challenges that suggest AAPL's valuation is not sustainable. We discuss why AAPL's price action is not constructive for a sustained rally.

Not only did revenue beat expectations, but earnings growth was positive on a year-over-year basis!

0,4550411,AAPL,2022-10-28T13:22:57-04:00,Consider Reaping High After Apple's Earnings Release,"Apple is likely trading at a 2-year premium, which investors may not be able to utilize again soon. I estimate the value of Apple to be $1.8 tn. Given its growth potential, I don't see Apple surpassing revenues of $700 bn and FCFF of $160 bn in the next decade. The market may be ignoring the changed price of risk and inflation effects on future growth and value. Scaling also becomes more difficult at this size. The expanded pricing is inconsistent with the expected future performance. Relative peer analysis indicates that Apple will have to outperform in-order to sustain the current pricing, while the outlook indicates a deceleration of the business.",Negative

Despite excessive ""fearmongering"" surrounding iPhone 14 demand, Tim Cook said that Apple's supply remains ""constrained"" versus demand. Apple proved once again that doubting the world's most valuable consumer company is a fool's errand. Following another strong quarter from Apple, I am confident to reiterate my ""Buy"" rating for AAPL stock. As a function of higher risk premia for Big Tech in general, and smaller EPS adjustments for Apple specifically, I lower my base case target price to $200.59.",Positive

Apple is being plagued by 3 headwinds - currency, China, and Europe, with currency impacting revenues by 1,000 basis points. Services is no longer the leading growth segment.

Keep Your Eyes On Services,"Apple has been a closely watched stock this earnings season as investors look to the consumer bellwether for hints of what's to come amid mounting macro uncertainties. The company posted upbeat third quarter results, mixed with tempered growth in core iPhone and Services sales. Yet, the company's earnings beat and sustained 70%+ margins in Services despite lighter-than-expected growth continue to underscore the critical role of the segment for Apple.

Apple's U-turn on its planned iPhone production ramp is a clear early warning signal for earnings to decline, but few investors are listening. Apple has also been a prime beneficiary of tax cuts, QE, and stimulus, while the underlying net income of its business looks more sluggish and cyclical.

This was the opposite title to my May 13, 2016 piece that mentioned that Apple shares were trading at their cheapest valuation levels in a decade. Over the past year, Apple shares have appreciated in-line with the performance of the S&P 500 Index, rising 35%. This is far different from the substantial outperformance from 2016-2020. My base-case fair value for Apple's shares is $100, implying downside of 32% from today's stock price, and Morningstar estimates Apple's fair value at $124 per share, roughly 16% downside. Apple's sheer size, relative lack of revenue growth, and still very lofty valuation levels are going to hinder performance going forward, and that's why Apple shares are an attractive hedge.",Positive

However, the headwinds are expected to be temporary with no significant impacts to Apple's long-term growth prospects and valuation.

Even more compelling is that 83 percent of these digital shifters say they will stick with some or all of those digital-first habits - even when they are able to interact in the physical world without the fear of COVID-19. Large-scale efforts to challenge Apple's position on allowing anyone other than Apple access to the NFC chip haven't gotten much media bandwidth. That may not be the case for long.

While the market averages may have brushed off much of the cornoavirus concern, Task notes about half the stocks in the Nasdaq are in bear markets - that is off 20% or more from 52-week highs. So take away the MAGA names and high-flyers like Tesla and Virgin Galactic, and it's already pretty ugly out there. Hibben isn't scared away by the gaudy one-year returns for a lot of the tech names he holds. He reminds that the big gains follow the major losses seen in the last few months of 2018. Still, Hibben acknowledges valuations are getting a little perky at these levels, and he's not finding a lot to buy right now. What Hibben calls new paradigm semiconductor companies (mostly Apple, but names like Samsung and Huawei also fit) are those that design most of the processors put into their products.

For Walmart and Ford, which are affected by the current tariffs, we found their stocks are traded at a significant 20%-25% discount to the levels if there were no tariffs. For Apple, which is exempt from the tariff impacts, we found no such discount. Thus, there are negative tariff impacts on most affected U.S. stock prices. For Bank of America, the company which is supposed to prosper in a rising interest rate environment, still trades at a similar tariffs discount.

The biggest problem with opioids is that they have the potential to cause addiction, and only provide moderate improvement for pain.",Positive

Despite this significant progress, Tesla may still have some room for improvement in its goal to reach the $100/kWh “magic number” that brings EVs to cost parity with ICE vehicles. Further reduction in cost may have to come via a decline in material cost through advances in recycling/recovery, change of chemistry in the battery, and/or access to the minerals themselves. This paper discusses a type of next-generation lithium-metal batteries that may be crucial for the second possibility, encouraging Tesla to learn about this opportunity and get ready to grasp it. Lastly, provided the new “Holy Grail” takes off and consolidates in the near future, the prospect demand for and subsequent production of lithium metal will imply profound changes in the upstream of the lithium value chain.",Positive

Automotive demand in the U.S. fell by close to 50% in the last two weeks of March, and anecdotes suggest over 80% drops even more recently. For Tesla, not only is production down in the U.S., but the demand drop-off suggests that the 88,400 reported in Q1 is likely the ceiling of what’s achievable in Q2.

Turning to other ideas, Willard prefers buying names when they're hated, and that sort of thing is hard in today's red-hot market. Of his five favorite stocks - Disney, Virgin Galactic, Spotify, Qualcomm, and Cisco, only Cisco qualifies as not having gone a pretty nice bull run of late.

Manufacturers (except FCA) are planning to meet the targets with increased BEV and PHEV production. FCA is pooling with Tesla, a move which I estimate could save €1 billion in fines. The emission penalties will effectively add $2,700 to the cost of sales for the average ICE car. However, the sale of a BEV can reduce penalties by as much as $20,000.

This makes it hard to evaluate or predict progress. Elon Musk's prediction that Tesla will solve full autonomy in 2020 may turn out to be wrong, but it isn't ridiculous on its face. An analogy to DeepMind's work on StarCraft shows why. If the technology works as hoped, the global robotaxi industry's combined valuation will eventually reach the triple-digit billions, if not trillions.",Positive

         Tesla’s share price implies confidence that, when the Model 3 hits volume production, that it will be able to deliver these margins.

         Given the persistent production issues and the need for radically more time and manpower to reach production rate targets, the promised margins look fanciful.

However, there are very real drawbacks to this capital intensive structure, which force Tesla's SG&A costs as a percent of sales to be well above competitors'. By chasing 100% of the profit in the channel, Tesla must deploy investors' capital on lower margin opportunities.

Research firm Bernstein has published a lengthy analysis of what may be going wrong with Model 3 production strategy, which may be far more complex than sleeping arrangements.

According to Bernstein's view, Tesla's manufacturing problems are intractable and may require redesign of both the manufacturing process, and possibly even the Model 3.

That would still leave untouched much larger markets for electric heavy-duty trucks in India and China. Tesla could earn substantial profits by quickly ramping sales of Semi powertrains to other truck makers, e.g., making one ""machine that builds the powertrain"" in India, and another in China. That would help Tesla spark a public relations coup: A global takeover by electric heavy-duty trucks which, powered with wind and solar, would cut global CO2 emissions by 12 percent.",Positive
